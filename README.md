# RRES (Retrofit-RxJava-EventBus-Service) Architecture Demo App #

Android sample app for showing the implementation of the 
__Networking / Data Access architecture__ described below using concrete use-cases.

## Architecture ##
__Retrofit__ with __RxJava__ for handling the REST API calls.  
__EventBus__ to deliver the results and updates back to the presentation layer.  
Rx features to handle errors, chained or parallel calls, fallback to offline store, and more.  
The whole component is placed in a __Android Service__ which starts on-demand and stops after some idle time when there are no more ongoing tasks.
  
##### Why them? #####
- __Retrofit__  
Provides a simple, declarative way to create the REST API client as a Java interface, 
while it is also highly configurable through the underlying OkHttp client.  
Supports RxJava return values.
- __RxJava__  
Makes it easier to combine calls or execute custom processing chains without keeping states.  
Makes threading simple and declarative.
- __EventBus__  
I believe for data access the decoupling of the publishers and subscribers by using an event bus
as middleman instead of using the more direct connection with callbacks and the observer pattern
can give some benefits and thus be a better approach.  
It gives the flexibility to send any kind of result, error, or progress update from any part of the processing chain
and let the interested UI controller(s) listen to them independently from the initiator and from each other.  
It allows us to separate the data access layer more easily without the need and difficulties of keeping
the direct callback references to the presentation layer.    
EventBus in particular has some useful features (threading, sticky events) over using for example the built-in BroadcastReceiver.
- __Android Service__   
We can control the Service's lifecycle, so it can work as a 'temporary singleton' while the network calls are executing.
So it can survive the configuration changes easily and also ensure to not keep a global singleton in memory
when it's not needed.  
A Service also has more guarantees from the system that while it is running it won't be killed,
which can be useful for some use-cases.  
(Note: It is also possible to simply use a singleton instead of the Service. That removes some complexity.)

## List of use-cases implemented  ##

- Basic use-case
    - Single network call __executed on background thread__, deliver results to UI on main thread
    - __Handle screen rotation__ (configuration change): deliver result on rotated screen without restarting the call
    - __Display loading indicator__ during the call
    - Can deliver result to different screen (user navigates to a different screen during the call)
- Error handling
    - __Error message__ displayed if something went wrong. __Different messages for different errors__.    
    - _Implementation_:  
    Errors propagate through the Rx chain and interpreted at single place at the end.  
    Error event is sent to presentation layer where message is decided.
- Ongoing call handling
    - There is only one call running at a time, __initiating the call again is ignored__.
    - _Implementation_:  
    Rx Subscription reference is kept and checked if subscribed.
- Offline storage
    - When online, network call is executed and result is saved and displayed
    - __When offline, data is loaded from offline store__
    - _Implementation_:  
    Using Rx operators _doOnSuccess_ and _onErrorResumeNext_ are used to construct the appropriate chain.
- Retry
    - __Retries the call if it fails__
    - _Implementation_:  
    Using Rx operator _RetryWhen_
- Cancelling
    - The ongoing __network call can be cancelled__
    - _Implementation_:  
    Retrofit supports cancelling the call down to the network layer through the returned Observable/Single\'s _unsubscribe()_ method.
- Double load
    - __Show offline data first__ if available but __load from server too and refresh the displayed value__.
    - Execute the operations in parallel.
    - _Implementation_:  
    By combining the two Rx Observables with operator _concatEager_.
- Parallel and Chained calls
    - User initiates a complex data access, receives the end result on the UI.
    - Requires __multiple network calls__. Both __parallel and sequential executions__ might be needed.
    - Shows __dialog about the progress steps__.
    - _Implementation_:  
    Rx operator _zip_ for parallel execution and _flatMap_ for sequential execution.  
    Progress update events can be sent to the presentation layer at any point in Rx chain.
- Background sync
    - Scheduled __background data sync__ with server. Even when the app is not running or used by the user.
    - _Implementation_:  
    The Service used for on-demand data access can be started up for syncing too.  
    (Scheduling is implemented simply with AlarmManager in this PoC but JobScheduler or GcmNetworkManager is a better solution in a real app).
- HTTP Cache
    - Cache the network responses according to their _Cache-Control_ headers
    - _Implementation_:  
    Retrofit backed by OkHttp can take care of the caching, just has to be configured.  
    (Need to be un-commented in code to enable it.)
